# Soothing Hues: Gradient Zen Garden

Thank you for coming to take a look at the code! I'm sure this is very interesting to some people, but for everyone else its a little boring. If Javascript and random walking functions arent your thing try heading back to the [Soothing Hues](http://randompixelartmaker.herokuapp.com) and pressing 's' to access the Secret Menu that is full of more fun parameters to play with!
